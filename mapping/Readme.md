# File Mapping

As far as I can tell, only the Switch edition of the game contains file names. The 
Steam edition has converted them all to numerical IDs and the Xbox version corrupts the 
names during extract in some cases. This folder contains mappings to restore file names to 
the Steam version. For Xbox videos, it maps them to corresponding Switch file names. For Xbox 
bg images, it maps the original file name to the Switch one.

The Xbox version of the game is missing these three bg images found in the Switch/Steam
